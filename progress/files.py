"""The two generated file formats, and the validators the merge gate runs on them.

`STATUS.md` is a snapshot: rewritten whole on every update, headed by the commit it describes.
`PROGRESS.md` is an append-only log of windows, each section headed by the commit range it covers.

Both carry a machine-readable HTML-comment header followed by prose, following the
`epsiloneridani-<kind>:v1 {json}` convention the rest of the project already uses for scoreboards and
target markers. A `STATUS.md` may also carry `epsiloneridani-coverage:v1` headers, the report's verdict
on each layer in a form a script can read (README.md, "The coverage header"): one for the area's
own README, and one for each sub-roadmap of an umbrella area. They have the standing of the prose
beside them: a model's account, not a checked claim.

Everything here is pure: it takes and returns text, touches no network and no filesystem. That
matters because the merge gate in CI runs these same functions on an untrusted PR's blobs, and it
is the only thing standing between a model and a human-owned repository. The gate proves *shape*,
never truth -- see the trust-boundary section of README.md.
