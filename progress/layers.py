"""A roadmap's layers, and the coverage block a status body ends with.

A roadmap README names the units of its plan as headings (`### Layer 3: ...`, `## Lane G: ...`,
`### Part A — ...`, `### Stage 2: ...`, or short labels such as `### L0A — ...`). A status report
assesses each of them, and `apply` turns that assessment into the `epsiloneridani-coverage:v1` header so a
script can aggregate it across roadmaps. The extraction rule is the consumer's
(`scripts/roadmap_progress.py` in the EpsilonEridani repository); the schema is `files.require_coverage`.

Pure: text in, values out.
